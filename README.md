# About me 
Hello my name is Debarun Chakrabortty. I am a first year B-Tech student at IIT ISM Dhanbad from Electronics and Communication Engineering department.Some of my areas of intrest are robotics,IOT,blockchain ,devlopment etc.

# Understanding the problem 

Agriculture land is one of the biggest resources in our country .Traditional methods of farming and irrigation are inefficient and require a lot of manpower.Instead of them automated systems can be used to irrigate agricultural land effectively.Some crops require highly specific conditions to give a proper yield which are really difficult to achieve through manual techniques.


# My division and Project
The division I choosed was IOT and found its implementation in the field of agriculture. A smart irrigation bot which could water the crops according to moisture content in the soil and which is cost effective.
Its a simple project which takes one parameter of the soil to moniter the growth of crops and takes the required action.The 3 major sensors along with modules used in this project are the soil moisture sensor ,a relay moduleand a servo motor.
All the components are coordinated with each other using an arduino uno.Software used to programme the arduino was arduino.ide  .The operations are performed on a submerged water pump through the relay module.

# Components used

arduino uno,
relay module,
water pump,
servo motor,
connecting wires,
breadboard,
soil moisture sensor.

# Work flow of project

step 1: The moisture content of the soil is sent to the arduino form the soil moisture sensor.

step 2: the data is then processed in the system and accordingly actions are taken.

step 3:  If the moisture content is below a certain figure then the realy  is turned on ,the water pump is turned ON and the servo motor turns to its midpoint.If not then the relay remains OFF and no further action is taken .

step 4: After the moisture content of the soil reaches the desires level the moisture sensor feeds the data to the arduino and relay is turned OFF ,the servo motor again returns to the neutral position.

# Future prospects

Futhur improvements can be done in this project by considering more than one parameters affecting the yield of the crop.a temperature and humidity sensor can be added to the setup along with a light sensor to measure the amount of sunlight recieved by the plant over time.All these parameters together can be used to device an irrigation plan for the crop to get maximum yield.
